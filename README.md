# 42_cub3D
A 3D raycasting project in C, using minilibX
Made in collaboration with [Acsts](https://github.com/Acsts)

The goal was to create a maze using raycasting similarly to Wolfenstein3D.
There is no end or exit but you can take a walk in it !

# Usage
```console
~ make
~ ./cub3D [map]
```
The maps are located in the `map/` folder.
This is `map/zelda_maze1.cub` :
