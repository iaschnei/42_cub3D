# 42_cub3D
This time a 3D project, still in C and still with minilibX !
Made with @Acsts

The goal was to create a maze using raycasting in the style of Wolfenstein3D.
You can only move around the maze and look around !

# Usage
As for so_long :
```console
~ make
~ ./so_long [map]
```
The maps are also in the `map/` folder.
This is `map/zelda_maze1.cub` :
